## Website Content

The website comprises a poem, "(Unnamed)" by Marcus Hill, alongside visualizations based on responses to four specific questions from the MADICS study. The questions and corresponding data include:

1. "Do you feel that Black people are respected?"
2. "Do you have a positive view on Blacks?"
3. "If blacks don't do well, it's because they don't work hard."
4. "Blacks have made valuable contributions to society."

## Connection Between Poem and Graphs

The poem, "(Unnamed)," explores themes of identity, resilience, and societal standards within the context of being Black. It metaphorically reflects the challenges faced by the Black community, touching on issues such as respect, positive perception, hard work stereotypes, and contributions to society.

The accompanying graphs visually represent survey responses related to these themes. By juxtaposing the poem with statistical insights, this project aims to provide a multidimensional exploration of the experiences and perceptions captured in the MADICS study.
